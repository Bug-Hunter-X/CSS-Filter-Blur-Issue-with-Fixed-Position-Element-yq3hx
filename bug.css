The CSS property `filter: blur(10px);` is applied to an element with `position: fixed;`.  This causes the blur effect to only apply to the element itself, not its surroundings as expected. The blurred effect won't extend beyond the fixed element's boundaries, even if it overlaps other elements. This is because fixed elements are removed from the document flow, thus impacting how the blur filter operates.
